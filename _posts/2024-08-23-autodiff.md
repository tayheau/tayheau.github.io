Automatic Differentiation (AutoDiff or AD) is a set of techniques used to evaluate the partial derivative of a function. Its strength comes from the fact that it's the most computationally effective way.

AD has a two-sided nature : it's partly symbolic and partly numerical since it keeps track of the expression (unlike the numerical method) and gives a final numerical value (unlike symbolic method).
